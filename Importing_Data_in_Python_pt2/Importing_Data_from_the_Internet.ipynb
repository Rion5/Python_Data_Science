This will support many of the free software projects your organization depends on, not just Beautiful Soup.\\nIf Beautiful Soup is useful to you on a personal level, you might like to read Tool Safety, a short zine I wrote about what I learned about software development from working on Beautiful Soup. Thanks!\\n\\nIf you have questions, send them to the discussion\\ngroup. If you find a bug, file it.\\nBeautiful Soup is a Python library designed for quick turnaround\\nprojects like screen-scraping. Three features make it powerful:\\n\\n\\nBeautiful Soup provides a few simple methods and Pythonic idioms\\nfor navigating, searching, and modifying a parse tree: a toolkit for\\ndissecting a document and extracting what you need. It doesn\\'t take\\nmuch code to write an application\\n\\nBeautiful Soup automatically converts incoming documents to\\nUnicode and outgoing documents to UTF-8. You don\\'t have to think\\nabout encodings, unless the document doesn\\'t specify an encoding and\\nBeautiful Soup can\\'t detect one. Then you just have to specify the\\noriginal encoding.\\n\\nBeautiful Soup sits on top of popular Python parsers like lxml and html5lib, allowing you\\nto try out different parsing strategies or trade speed for\\nflexibility.\\n\\n\\nBeautiful Soup parses anything you give it, and does the tree\\ntraversal stuff for you. You can tell it \"Find all the links\", or\\n\"Find all the links of class externalLink\", or \"Find all the\\nlinks whose urls match \"foo.com\", or \"Find the table heading that\\'s\\ngot bold text, then give me that text.\"\\n\\nValuable data that was once locked up in poorly-designed websites\\nis now within your reach. Projects that would have taken hours take\\nonly minutes with Beautiful Soup.\\n\\nInterested? Read more.\\nDownload Beautiful Soup\\nThe current release is Beautiful Soup\\n4.8.0 (July 20, 2019).
